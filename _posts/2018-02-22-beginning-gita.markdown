The Why? What? and How? for Gita Project<br><br>

Why?
The world is full of surprises. Anywhere you look, you will learn something new about the world including yourself. The best part is human perception. If you look at something say 'x', and then 10 other people look at the same 'x' everyone's interpretation of 'x' will be different. I have always been curious about several aspects about the world and this project is one of my first attempts to understand one of those aspects -> Lifestyles (or some like to say Religion).

Having grown up in the holy city of Amritsar (India), home to the holiest shrine of Sikhs: <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Temple">The Golden Temple</a>. I was (I am still) amazed by how so many people from all walks of life (poor/rich/elderly/children) and from all over the world come together on the concept of faith. This is just one of the many examples in the world where people come together without any discrimination, with pure thoughts and dedication, and unite for the one truth of life. Other examples include: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela">Kumbh Mela</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca">Mecca</a>, and the rest you can Google. What is it that makes the books like 'Gita', 'Mahabharata', 'Bible', 'Quran', 'Guru Granth Sahib' inspire people to follow them? What is it that makes them so unique and powerful that the concepts defined in them have lasted generations? What does bring people together?

There is a quote, 'If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together'. I believe that studying such texts may give us the guidelines to design a sustainable society that doesn't just progress fast but also lasts for many generations to come.

What?
As I said, this is one of my first attempts. In this project I would be writing a series of blog posts that will have my interpretations from the verses of 'Gita'. This project is inspired by one of my academic mentors, <a href="http://www.gdeepak.com/">Dr. Deepak Garg</a> who has his own collection of posts about Gita <a href="http://www.gdeepak.com/bhagwadgita_1.php">here</a>. Also, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/hemangsk">Hemang Kumar</a> for this wonderful jekyll theme, Gravity.

How?
Although I am busy mostly with my graduate coursework. I will try to find time once a week and publish 1-2 blog posts. I hope you like the posts and feel free to contact me on email for questions/comments and I will reply to you as and when possible: <a href="mailto:akshit.arora@colorado.edu">akshit.arora@colorado.edu</a>

Thanks!
